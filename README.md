# Arabic Handwritten Text Identification

The project focuses on identifying Arabic handwritten text using local feature extraction techniques such as SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) and SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features). The evaluation criteria include accuracy, time efficiency, robustness to variations, and the number of detected key points. The AHAWP dataset is used for training and testing, containing 8,144 word images written by 82 individuals.
